/// Closure is a function that is combined with its outer lexical environment.

/// When a function relies on the variables from its outer scope,
/// interpreter creates a closure in order to store values on the heap.

//// Closure fuctions require more memory because it is stored on a heap and more computation.

/// Practical reasons to use closures:

/// Data encapsulation.
